*Heating Machine*

This is a web-based app that allows the user to place their computer device under different performance loads, with the express goal of turning their computer into a pseudo-heating device, and for the funsies.
The Heating Machine app must have robust safety and control features, to keep the performance load controlled, and also provide ample data and statistics on the performance of their device and the induced load/resulting heating.
